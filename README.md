# Virtual Bucket
## 
Virtual Bucket is a web application that allows users to store data hosted on the AWS cloud. This web application allows users to upload, download, update, and delete files. The files are stored in S3 buckets, and metadata is maintained in the dynamo DB of each user using the application. This app is accessible through a public domain myvirtualbucket.com. This 3-tier application meets all the requirements by making it a highly scalable, highly available, and cost-efficient solution. The application utilizes various AWS services such as EC2, ELB, CloudWatch, SNS, R53, Cognito, CloudFront, S3, and DynamoDB.
